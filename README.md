# Sfari Project
This is a project in which we will collect data from children 8-12 on the spectrum, siblings of people on the spectrum and controls. They will do several paradigms that we will analyse together. 

**Table of Paradigms**
  
1. [ASSR](#assr)
2. [AVSRT](#avsrt)
3. [Beep Flash](#beep-flash)
4. [F.A.S.T. Response Task](#f.a.s.t-response-task)
5. [Illusory Contours](#illusory-contours)
6. [Optical Flow (MoBI)](#optical-flow-(mobi))
7. [Restingstate](#resting-state)


## ASSR
[Click here to see the readme file with the paradigm information](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/ASSR).  
[Click here to see the readme file with the pipeline explained](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/sfari-analysis-pipelines/blob/main/ASSR.md)  
  
## AVSRT
[Click here to see the readme file with the paradigm information](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/avsrt)
Since this paradigm has been using in the lab for a long time we did not pilot for this project, but any pipeline should be adjustable to use for it
