# Sfari Project
This is a project in which we will collect data from children 8-12 on the spectrum, siblings of people on the spectrum and controls. They will do several paradigms that we will analyse together. 

**Table of Paradigms**
  
1. [ASSR](#assr)
2. [Beep Flash](#beep-flash)
3. [F.A.S.T. Response task](#f.a.s.t-response-task)
4. [Illusory Contours](#illusory-contours)
5. [Optical Flow (MObI)](#optical-flow-(mobi))
6. [Restingstate](#resting-state)
